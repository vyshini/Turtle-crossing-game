# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A simple arcade-style Turtle Crossing Game built using Python’s built-in `turtle` module.  
The objective of the game is to help the turtle cross the road while avoiding moving cars. Each time the turtle successfully reaches the top, the level increases and the cars move faster.

## 🎮 Game Objective

- Control the turtle and help it cross the road.
- Avoid getting hit by moving cars.
- Each successful crossing increases the level.
- The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Turtle Graphics (`turtle` module)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
